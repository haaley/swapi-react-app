# swapi-react-app

This project is a React app built with Vite, a fast development build tool.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version v16.15.0)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/haaley/swapi-react-app

Navigate to the project directory:

    
    cd swapi-react-app
    
Install the dependencies using npm or Yarn:

    
    npm install

or

      
      yarn install



## Development


Start the development server:

      
      npm run dev

or

      
      yarn dev
This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the app.

Edit the source files located in the src directory to modify the app according to your needs. The app uses React components, which are located in the src/components directory.

## Build

To build the app for production, run the following command:
      
      npm run build

or

      yarn build
This will create an optimized production-ready build of your app in the dist directory.

Deployment
You can deploy the built app to a web server or any static hosting platform by uploading the contents of the dist directory.
